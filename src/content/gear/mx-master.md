After years of using various mice, the MX Master 3 is hands-down the best I've ever used. The ergonomic shape fits my hand perfectly, and the precision scroll wheel is a game-changer.

## Key features

- **MagSpeed scrolling**: The electromagnetic scroll wheel can spin freely or click precisely
- **Multi-device**: Easily switch between up to 3 devices with a button press
- **Customizable buttons**: Extra buttons can be programmed for common tasks
- **USB-C charging**: One charge lasts for months

The horizontal scroll wheel on the side is perfect for timeline editing and wide spreadsheets. Worth every penny.
