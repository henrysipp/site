The Framework Laptop 16 is my daily driver for development work. What sets it apart is its complete modularity - every component can be upgraded or replaced without special tools.

## Why I chose it

- **Right to repair**: Framework's commitment to repairability means I can fix or upgrade anything myself
- **Performance**: Runs everything I throw at it, from Docker containers to local dev servers
- **Future-proof**: When I need more RAM or storage, I can just swap modules instead of buying a new laptop

## Current specs

- AMD Ryzen processor
- 32GB DDR5 RAM
- 1TB NVMe SSD
- 16" display

The build quality is excellent and the keyboard feels great for long coding sessions. Highly recommended for anyone who values sustainability and repairability.
