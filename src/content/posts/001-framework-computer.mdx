  The Framework 13 HX370

I've been daily driving a Framework Laptop 13 for the past few months and have some thoughts. For anyone who knows me this sounds like absolute lunacy; I've been a zealous Apple fan for nearly 15 years now. Apple makes pretty darn great computers. That still remains the case, but over the past decade and a half something has changed. Perhaps its just a part of the same broad dismissal of big tech that I've been on lately but I've finally found myself far more critical of a company that I trusted to just make *insanely great* computers. 

Mind you, most of my gripes are on the company's recent missteps on the software and business direction side of things, I still strongly believe that the latest Macbook Pro hardware remains the best physical manifestation of a laptop that you can purchase. But what if the computing freedom you lost by purchasing that machine was no longer worth the trade off? Apple products have always been sold as part of a social-contract of sorts: by limiting the choices available on their platform they are able to create a more curated path for workflow and productivity for their users. I could go off on this tangent for many, many more words but if you've been paying remote attention to the news lately you've probably read about their [non-cooperation](https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/06/05/apple-appeal-denied-antisteering) to anti-trust judgments, [internal struggle](https://www.theinformation.com/articles/apple-fumbled-siris-ai-makeover) around Apple Intelligence, and just a minor one from last week: [pushing ads](https://daringfireball.net/2025/06/more_on_apples_trust-eroding_f1_the_movie_wallet_ad) through Apple Wallet. 

All of this to say, when I sought to replace my aging Macbook Pro this year I decided to grab a ladder and peer over this walled garden to finally take a look at the rest of the industry and I have to say... its ok. I had decided that I want to run Linux on this machine, as Windows was in generally out of the question. I feel like I don't even need to explain myself on this one but among other things [ads](https://www.pcmag.com/how-to/how-to-remove-most-annoying-ads-from-windows) on the desktop and [spyware](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/retrace-your-steps-with-recall-aa03f8a0-a78b-4b3e-b0a1-2eb8ac48701c) being added in the sake of today's latest tech hype cycle are both non-starters. I've also been running Linux on my gaming desktop for a few months now without too many issues, but its a very basic install and I've never pushed it for really anything other than installing Steam and pressing "play" (side note: Valve has done incredible work on this front in the past few years!).

Given the prerequisite of Linux, my options were *somewhat* limited. In general many of the computers I'd want with good Linux support are also just generally great laptops. Most Thinkpads from Lenovo and enterprise laptops from Dell are solidly supported, but on a whim I came across this article on the [Framework 13](https://world.hey.com/dhh/the-new-framework-13-hx370-68675e0e) highlighting DHH's unbounded enthusiasm for these machines. I remembered seeing some LTT videos on Framework when they launched years ago and thought the concept was interesting, but wasn't motivated to trust such a young company on their long term promises. Five years on, they've kept kept those promises, and seem to be producing quite a great computer. Though the Framework's hardware is quite decent it is certainly not what sets them apart.

First and foremost it is *repairable*, in fact the computer shipped as multiple parts and I had to assemble it myself. Every part of this computer is able to be swapped out and Framework sells an abundance of replacement parts on [their store](https://frame.work/marketplace). Internal modules are all labeled with QR codes that lead to YouTube guides. There are extra screws in the spare space in the chassis like extra buttons on a shirt in case you lose one! 

My spec includes the AMD HX370. It's fast but not necessarily on par with Apple's current generation Pro-series chips but the gap is shrinking with every generation. 

The screen on the Framework is actually quite interesting. I opted for their high-resolution high refresh rate variant. It's a 3:2 aspect ratio, and is 2880x1920 @ 256ppi. The latest MacBook Pro is 254ppi. I'm not sure I would trust it for color accurate work, but working with text all day is crisp. I'm sure the 2x resolution saves me from many a headache, I know Linux fractional display scaling is like sailing through treacherous waters.

Otherwise, a general list of thoughts on the rest of the hardware in no particular order:

- Modular I/O is very cool. 
- The touchpad is fine, its not as good as the Apple one. I'm hoping Framework releases a haptic touchpad that I can swap this out for but it gets the job done.
- The keyboard is better than Apple's. The new Macbook keyboards post butterfly-switch are alright, but the travel distance on the Framework's keys feel reminiscent of the original keyboard on the 2010-era unibody which I love so much more.
- The down-firing speakers are quite mediocre. Luckily the headphone jack has a very low noise floor.

With all this in mind it is true that there are many compromises when compared to my last five years old machine. So why take this "downgrade" instead of a Thinkpad or XPS? For me it truly boils down to the fact that Framework just respects my intelligence as a consumer. There is some sort of mutual trust between Framework the company and their users, another social contract of sorts but in a very opposite manner than the one Apple provides. They offer powerful, customizable, and serviceable machines a nd are philosophically centered on extending the usable lifespan of their devices. For now they feel like the "good guys" spearheading the right to repair movement in a way that anyone can get behind. I can't ask for much more.

In a few more years when I've used this laptop and once again have the opportunity to upgrade to latest-generation hardware, I can't wait to just swap a mainboard in and give it new life.
