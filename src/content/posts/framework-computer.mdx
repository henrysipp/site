Apple makes pretty darn great computers. This hasn't [always](https://appleinsider.com/articles/22/07/19/apple-agrees-to-50m-settlement-in-macbook-butterfly-keyboard-lawsuit) been the case, but over the past 15 years of using Macintosh as my primary computing platform they've more or less delivered on the "it just works" philosophy with only a few hiccups; definitely less problems overall than their contemporaries. Modern Macs with Apple Silicon are especially well executed machines: faster and more power efficient than any competitor with an incredibly premium unibody design that for some reason no one has been able to accurately replicate in nearly two decades. The software experience too has always been intuitive and charming to say the least. I remember being delighted the time I first booted up my MacBook Pro and saw that Snow Leopard [startup sequence](https://youtube.com/watch?v=5DSXz9xst5k). 

MacOS being built on top of Unix and BSD roots also has huge advantages for software engineering. It's a pretty settled story now that Linux has become the de facto platform for server computing and having a native Unix environment on Mac gives developers far more core skills that transfer directly, not to mention the abundance of cross-platform software. It is so important that even Microsoft [added support](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/) for Linux in Windows years ago, which has been [gaining steadily](https://survey.stackoverflow.co/2024/technology) in popularity since its release. It seems like most developers I talk to in startups lately either use a Mac or develop exclusively in WSL.

In recent years, however, it has been jarring seeing the company whose technology I've built my career on show nothing but [contempt](https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/06/05/apple-appeal-denied-antisteering) for their developers as of late. Paired with some [blatant lies](https://stratechery.com/2025/apple-and-its-intelligence-gaps/) on future promises and reports of massive [internal struggle](https://www.theinformation.com/articles/apple-fumbled-siris-ai-makeover) among other issues, I've found myself swing from unquestioning fanboy to a far more cynical and critical outlook of the company. Don't get me wrong, I still believe the products coming from Cupertino are some of the best in the world and offer the most seamless experience in tech, but I'm finding it an increasingly questionable practice anchoring myself to any Big Tech companies going forward.

Things have been changing as of late on the competitor side as well. Apple's shakeup with the release of the M-series processors seems to have caused the entire industry to kick things into high gear. Intel's latest Lunar Lake series chips are extremely promising on the [power efficiency](https://www.laptopmag.com/laptops/overall-intel-lunar-lake-battery-life-rundown-which-new-intel-lunar-lake-laptop-comes-out-on-top) side, rivaling Apple's 18-hour battery life. AMD too is creating AI 300 mobile chips with multi-core [benchmarks](https://browser.geekbench.com/v6/cpu/12316580) coming strikingly close to the latest and greatest [M4 Pro](https://browser.geekbench.com/v6/cpu/12319983). The gaps are still there but shrinking with every new product launch. It may not be long until Apple is *just another competitor* in the market. With this in mind, I decided to do more research for my five-year personal laptop upgrade cadence. It's almost a little funny that Apple's hardware is maybe the best it's ever been but I'm also more eager than ever to peer over the top of the walls of their garden to see what's outside. 

I decided almost immediately that Windows was out of the question. [Ads](https://www.pcmag.com/how-to/how-to-remove-most-annoying-ads-from-windows) being shown on the desktop, an unusable search experience, (and the worst) outright [spyware](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/retrace-your-steps-with-recall-aa03f8a0-a78b-4b3e-b0a1-2eb8ac48701c) being added in the sake of today's latest tech hype cycle are all non-starters. Furthermore while WSL is a massive step forward for working on Windows it also just feels like a compromise at this point that I'm not willing to make. Instead of using Windows and a Linux VM why not try loading it bare metal?

I've been running Linux for a few months already on my gaming rig without many issues. I was convinced after finally being pushed over the edge by Windows Recall, and the Steam Deck showed promises of a road less taken. It's been pretty basic, just Steam and a web browser, but surprisingly powerful. I hadn't *really* made an effort to set it up for development until a few weeks ago and wow it's so much better than I anticipated. I have a high penchant for tinkering and wading through much of the BS required to get something working, but that hasn't really been necessary beyond some minor  issues that were solved with a 10-minute investigation on the [Arch wiki](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/PipeWire#Audio_problems_after_standby).

With Linux in mind I eventually found and landed on the [Framework Laptop 13](https://frame.work/laptop13). For Linux support it looks like most ThinkPads and modern Dell laptops are solidly supported, but if I'm going to downgrade from Mac hardware I want not just merely another laptop but something different too, and wow is the Framework different! In many ways this computer is the antithesis of the Macintosh. 

First and foremost it is *repairable*, in fact the computer shipped as multiple parts and I had to assemble it myself (assembled versions are an option for a price premium). Every part of this computer is able to be swapped out and Framework sells an abundance of replacement parts on [their store](https://frame.work/marketplace). Internal modules are all labeled with QR codes that lead to YouTube guides. There are extra screws in the spare space in the chassis like extra buttons on a shirt in case you lose one! 

Maybe the best part, the I/O of this computer is hot-swappable! I've configured mine with two USB-C, one USB-A, and an SD card reader, but I keep an HDMI module in my backpack in case I need it on the go. The modules are smaller than any standard dongle too. Carrying extras around feels great, not like I *have* to.

My spec includes the latest AMD HX370. It's fast but not necessarily on par with Apple's current generation Pro-series chips. I'm not sure I care, it's fast enough for everything I've thrown at it so far. Modern software engineering at side-project or startup scale isn't actually that computationally intensive and I'm fine not trying to run LLMs locally.

The screen on the Framework is actually *really* interesting. I opted for their high-resolution high refresh rate variant. It's a 3:2 aspect ratio, taller and more square than most widescreen laptops today. The "new" display arrived with their refresh late 2024 and is 2880x1920 @ 256ppi. The latest MacBook Pro is 254ppi. Linux scaling and text rendering have never looked better, but color accuracy and brightness are still solidly owned by the MacBook.

What the Mac can't claim to be the best at is keyboard feel. The latest M series Mac laptops have a new keyboard that is leagues better than last generation (though just about anything is). Having upgraded from an Apple butterfly keyboard to the latest variant I was convinced that Apple's latest designs must be some of the best in the industry. That was wrong. That was Stockholm syndrome. The Framework has a far more usable and comfortable keyboard than any of Apple's latest laptops. It feels like the golden age from Apple's original 2008 unibody design. It's an actual keyboard, not just some rows of tactile clicky plastic.

The Framework still has its quirks though, it's definitely not perfect. Mac laptops are truly the gold standard of hardware and every single machine on the market is a downgrade in some way, shape, or form, so let's talk about those.

The speakers are mediocre at best. They're tinny and sound highly cupped (like put your hand over your mouth while speaking) with no bass response. They're okay for watching the odd YouTube video or podcast but listening to music or watching movies is out of the question. Side-by-side with the MacBook they're almost embarrassingly bad. The good news is that the headphone jack has a near-silent noise floor. I can listen with very sensitive IEMs without issue. The DAC/Amp stack in this machine is quite good and helps make up for the other sonic shortcomings.

The touchpad is fine. Gestures work as expected and it's pretty accurate. Linux input drivers have also come a *long way* since I last checked. Coming from Apple it's still quite lacking, however. The touchpad is mechanical, not haptic, and large but not large enough. Sometimes clicks vs click-and-drag get confused (a firmware issue?) which can be very annoying. I find it cumbersome where I found the Mac intuitive. Luckily, I've been able to move most of my workflow to keyboard anyway. Linux display managers are well tuned for keyboard-only operation. Now that I've spent the time upfront, I can't imagine moving my hands every two seconds to touch my mouse anyway. 

With all of this in mind, everything I've said and really have to say about this machine really boils down to two main points: 

- This is meant to be a customizable and repairable computer.
- Framework the company respects your intelligence as a consumer. 

These points are why I'm not only willing but excited to sacrifice a more luxury computing experience. This feels like a far cry from Apple's (and everyone else copying them) distrust of the consumer. I understand, most people aren't tech-literate and either don't want to or are unable to muck around with Linux and computer hardware. But is it really so hard to ask for a user-replaceable battery? What happened to the old Apple who [endorsed](https://support.apple.com/en-us/105126) reusing old computers when they were end-of-life? I want to feel empowered by my technology not hindered by it. The Framework entices my curiosity with computers in an almost childlike sense of wonder that I thought I'd lost many years ago. This is a tinkerer's machine made for makers, a software engineer's dream. In a few more years when it has become obsolete hardware I can't wait to swap a new mainboard in and give it new life.
