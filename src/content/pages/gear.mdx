# Software

## Engineering

- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) primary editor
- [Lazy Vim](https://lazyvim.github.io) secondary editor
- [Operator Mono](https://typography.com/blog/introducing-operator) font

- [Ghostty](https://ghostty.org) terminal emulator
- [Zsh](https://zsh.sourceforge.io/) shell



## Environment

My work-provided computer is macOS, every other machine runs Linux.

I use [NixOS](https://nixos.org) (and the Nix package manager for Mac) on all of my computers to keep a deterministic configuration for all dotfiles and common programs. NixOS is also my Linux distro of choice for personal devices + homelab servers and manages everything from drivers to my desktop environment.

You may find an up-to-date copy of my setup [here](https://github.com/henrysipp/nix-setup).



## Other Software

- [Zen](https://zen-browser.app) web browser
- [1Password](https://1password.com) password manager
- [Typora](https://typora.com) markdown editor
  - Primarily for personal notes + writing
  - Might check out [Inkdrop](https://inkdrop.com) soon. I love how it looks and that it is also created + run by a solo developer
- [Hey](https://hey.com) email + calendar
- [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com) docs + storage




# Computer Hardware
**Work**

- ~~Macbook Pro 14" M1 Max (2021)~~
- Framework Laptop 13" AMD Ryzen AI 9 HX 370 (what a mouthful)
- [HHKB Bluetooth](https://hhkeyboard.us/) keyboard
- [Apple Magic Mouse](https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MXK53AM/A/magic-mouse-usb%E2%80%91c-white-multi-touch-surface).

> The Macbook Pro is best computer I have ever purchased and likely the best I ever will. While on my regular 4-5 year upgrade cadence I made the decision this time to replace it not with a Mac (as I have since 2011), but with a Framework Laptop 13. I found the Linux experience to have come astonishingly far in the past few years to the point that I finally feel like I'm no longer missing anything crucial.



**Play**

- Mac Studio M1 Max
  - Traded my wife the Macbook Pro for this. It acts as a home server and remote machine when I need to do iOS development

- Gaming PC Specs

  - Asus ProArt Z790 Creator WIFI

  - Intel Core i7 13700k

  - NVidia Geforce RTX 4080

  - Corsair Vengeance 32GB

  - NZXT Kraken AIO

- [Icron Dock](https://www.icron.com/product-category/usb-extenders/) Cat6 USB Extender
  - The only >10ft USB extension I've found that actually works
  
-  [Alienware 34” QD-OLED](https://www.dell.com/en-us/shop/alienware-32-4k-qd-oled-gaming-monitor-aw3225qf/apd/210-blmq/monitors-monitor-accessories) monitor

- [Rama Works U80-A](https://ramaworks.store/products/u80-a-seq2) keyboard
- [Logitech G-Pro Superlight](https://www.logitechg.com/en-us/products/gaming-mice/pro-x-superlight-wireless-mouse.html) mouse

> This computer sits in a server rack in my basement. I interface with it using the Icron USB extender and a fiber-optic DisplayPort cable.



# Music
AKA audiophile mental illness

- [Roon](https://roon.app/en/) and [Roon Arc](https://roon.app/en/arc) music streaming.
- [Kef LSX II](https://us.kef.com/products/lsx-2) speakers
- [ZMF Atrium](https://shop.zmfheadphones.com/products/atrium) headphones 
- [Campfire Andromeda](https://www.campfireaudio.com/products/andromeda-emerald-sea) IEMs
- [Sony NW-ZX707](https://electronics.sony.com/audio/walkman-digital-recorders/all-walkman-digital-recorders/p/nwzx707-b) digital media player
  - This one is the Japanese model, bought on eBay. This brings two advantages. The first being that it is much cheaper than buying new, the second that Sony has an aggressive volume limit on western models that severely harms the unit’s usability.

> I don't like to support any of the music streaming SaaS products, buying one or two CDs or digital downloads per month supports the artists that I care about more than a lifetime of streaming would. (Its also _actually_ lossless)

# Photography & Videography

- [Leica D-Lux 8](https://leica-camera.com/en-US/photography/cameras/d-lux/d-lux-8) primary portable on-the-go shooter

- [Sony A7IV](https://electronics.sony.com/imaging/interchangeable-lens-cameras/all-interchangeable-lens-cameras/p/ilce7m4-b) professional-grade shots
  - Usually operated by my wife

- [Lightroom](http://adobe.com/products/photoshop-lightroom) editing, usually the web version on Linux
