# Software

## Engineering

- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) primary editor
- [Lazy Vim](https://lazyvim.github.io) secondary editor
- [Operator Mono](https://typography.com/blog/introducing-operator) font

- [Ghostty](https://ghostty.org) terminal emulator
- [Zsh](https://zsh.sourceforge.io/) shell



## Environment

My work-provided computer is macOS, every other machine runs Linux.

I use [NixOS](https://nixos.org) (and the Nix package manager for Mac) on all of my computers to keep a deterministic configuration for all dotfiles and common programs. NixOS is also my Linux distro of choice for personal devices + homelab servers and manages everything from drivers to my desktop environment.

You may find an up-to-date copy of my setup [here](github.com/henrysipp/nix-setup).



## Other Software

- [Zen](https://zen-browser.app) web browser
- [1Password](https://1password.com) password manager
- [Typora](https://typora.com) markdown editor
  - Primarily for personal notes + writing
  - Might check out [Inkdrop](https://inkdrop.com) soon. I love how it looks and that it is also created + run by a solo developer
- [Hey](https://hey.com) email + calendar
- [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com) docs + storage




# Computer Hardware
**Work**

- ~~Macbook Pro 14" M1 Max (2021)~~
- Framework Laptop 13" AMD Ryzen AI 9 HX 370
- Mac Studio M1 Max
  - Traded my wife the Macbook Pro for this. It acts as a home server and remote machine when I need to do iOS development
- [HHKB Bluetooth](https://hhkeyboard.us/) keyboard
- [Apple Magic Mouse](https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MXK53AM/A/magic-mouse-usb%E2%80%91c-white-multi-touch-surface).

> The Macbook Pro is best computer I have ever purchased and likely the best I ever will. While on my regular 4-5 year upgrade cadence I made the decision this time to replace it not with a Mac (as I have since 2011), but with a Framework Laptop 13. I found the Linux experience to have come astonishingly far in the past few years to the point that I finally feel like I'm no longer missing anything crucial.

> This computer sits in a server rack in my basement. I interface with it using the Icron USB extender and a fiber-optic DisplayPort cable.



# Music
Most of my music listening today happens locally. I don’t stream that much.

I use [Roon](https://roon.app/en/) to listen to music from my NAS at home. If you have a local music library and have not tried Roon I highly recommend it. The metadata and discovery features bring it on par with modern SaaS options.

At my desk I use [Kef LSX II](https://us.kef.com/products/lsx-2) speakers. They are probably the largest single upgrade in sound quality I’ve done, though the firmware can be very fiddly.

I also use [ZMF Atrium](https://shop.zmfheadphones.com/products/atrium) headphones when it is necessary to keep noise levels down. More often nowadays since my home office is below the nursery.

Outside of the house I use a [Sony NW-ZX707](https://electronics.sony.com/audio/walkman-digital-recorders/all-walkman-digital-recorders/p/nwzx707-b) Digital Media Player. I find that the default Walkman app is sufficient for my needs.

> This one is the Japanese model, bought on eBay. This brings two advantages. The first being that it is much cheaper than buying new, the second that Sony has an aggressive volume limit on western models that severely harms the unit’s usability.

The Sony is nearly always paired with [Campfire Andromeda](https://www.campfireaudio.com/products/andromeda-emerald-sea) IEMs. 

# Photography & Videography

Although I carry an iPhone I try and avoid using it as my primary camera. I find the experience of slowing down and focusing with a real camera through a viewfinder much more enjoyable.

I use a [Leica D-Lux 8](https://leica-camera.com/en-US/photography/cameras/d-lux/d-lux-8) as my primary on-the-go camera. The micro 4/3’s sensor isn’t an issue for my skill level, I won’t be hitting that ceiling any time soon, and I enjoy how adorably small it is. 

For more “professional” work I borrow my wife’s [Sony A7IV](https://electronics.sony.com/imaging/interchangeable-lens-cameras/all-interchangeable-lens-cameras/p/ilce7m4-b) with the added bonus of it usually coming with her assistance.

Occasionally, I will shoot a roll of film with my Asahi Pentax Spotmatic that I also bought from Japanese eBay.

> I loathe the menus and buttons and clutter on the A7IV. I’m sure for professional photographers having every option you could imagine at your fingertips is *very useful*, but as an amateur who just likes shooting on the weekends I feel lost every time I hold it.

I edit my photos in [Lightroom](http://adobe.com/products/photoshop-lightroom) like everyone else. I dislike how Lightroom CC removed the library organization features found in Lightroom Classic. As such, I use a mix of both: Lightroom Classic for library organization, and Lightroom CC for photo editing (performance is much more optimized on CC).
