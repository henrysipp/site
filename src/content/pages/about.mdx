# Work

Hi, I'm Henry

I'm currently a Staff Software Engineer at [Homebound](https://homebound.com), a tech-enabled national home builder. 

From 2022-2025 I worked at [Meta](https://facebook.com) on Facebook Communities, Messenger, Comments, and Groups. From 2021-2022 I worked at [Spreetail](https://spreetail.com) on platform support and developer tooling+experience. Before that, from 2017-2021 I worked at [Archrival](https://archrival.com) creating internal software managing field programs for some of the world's largest brands. 

Since 2019 I have operated Hokum Guru, and from 2021-2022 I co-founded and managed BAD Apps, both software consultancies. Under Hokum Guru I have primarily acted as fractional CTO, offering my technical knowledge and experience for small startups. As operator of BAD Apps I employed and managed other engineers building MVPs for small businesses and entrepreneurs.
