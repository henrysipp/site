# Work

I started at Meta in spring of 2022 and joined the Facebook Communities team, a subset of Groups. I worked on Community Messaging until the org was re-absorbed into Facebook Groups in late-2023. Since then I have worked on the core Groups product.

While at Facebook I have primarily worked on content creation and messaging initiatives. As part of Communities I brought end to end encrypted messaging feature parity to the Facebook iOS app, making the overnight transition for a billion users seamless. As part of Groups I have maintained and overhauled core sharing and content creation features, helping spur more meaningful and impactful discussions on the platform.

Since 2019 I have operated Hokum Guru, and in 2021-22 I co-founded and managed BAD Apps, both software consultancies. Under Hokum Guru I have primarily acted as fractional CTO, offering my technical knowledge and experience for small startups. As operator of BAD Apps I employed and managed a few other engineers building MVPs for small businesses and entrepreneurs. While we saw commercial success, we were forced to shut down due to health issues with one of our partners. 

Before Facebook I worked at [Spreetail](https://www.spreetail.com/), an e-commerce company here in Lincoln for two years. At Spreetail I acted as tech lead to create an internal platform, bringing unified developer standards and tooling to teams across the company as they worked to split Spreetail’s decade-old monolith into a micro-services architecture. I also architected and implemented Spreetail’s first in-house resource based authorization system, conducted dozens of engineering interviews, and overhauled Spreetail’s internal design system React components.

My experiences before Spreetail are varied, but included [Archrival](https://archrival.com) (4 years) and [Kodestarters](https://www.kodestarters.com/) (2 years).

# Family
I met my wife Mattie in 2015 and married her in October of 2021. Together we have one child, and another on the way sometime in July of this year.
